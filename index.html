      This is amount of concussions overall in sports in 2017-2018
      The increase in reported sports-related concussions is due to a combination of factors, including greater awareness of concussion risks, improved diagnostic and reporting practices, and potentially a true rise in concussion incidence. Factors like contact sports, sports-specific rules, and athlete participation rates also play a role.

        <h2>Community</h2>
        Concussions can significantly impact communities by affecting individual well-being, relationships, and participation in daily activities. This can lead to reduced social engagement, isolation, and challenges in school or work. Additionally, concussions can exacerbate existing mental health concerns and increase the risk of long-term health issues.

        <h2>Saftey</h2>
        Concussions can trigger or worsen symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns, impacting emotional well-being and potentially leading to substance abuse or even suicide.
        While rare, there is an elevated risk of suicide in individuals who have suffered concussions, particularly those with repeated injuries.
